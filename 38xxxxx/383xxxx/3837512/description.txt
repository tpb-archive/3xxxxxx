Message is a great movie about a great period in the history of world history, and that is the advent of the last of the great monotheistic religions called Islam. It does well to convey the basic message of Islam and its founder Prophet Muhammed (p.b.u.h.). Of course, the detractors of Islam will not find the movie all that enjoyable. But irrespective of whether one is a Muslim or not, the movie certainly does well to deliver an entertaining panorama of events and action. 

The late Moustapha al-Akkad, who also made the film \"Lion of the Desert\", made a film that did all it could to be in sync with Islamic religious sensibilities, but at the same be historicaly accurate. If there is one criticism that could be surmised about the Message was the fact the film failed to zone in on other aspects of Prophet Muhammed\'s life and message, but being a movie, one cannot simply include everything, which puts the director and film\'s makers off the hook, so to speak. 

I recommed this film for all ages. It\'s a movie that will be treasured as a 
classic.
