This is all of the articles from the beginning of the New Left Review until October 2007.  Thats around 40 some odd years.  It was quite a chore to get them all, but if someone would like to rename these articles with the article titles, I am sure people down the road would appreciate it.  

Please subscribe to the New Left Review if you like what you are reading here, it is a great journal and many people who have greatly influenced radical/progressive/liberal/marxist/feminist/poststructuralist thinking have contributed to it.

It is pretty reasonable for a subscription, and you can read the hard copy.  They sometimes give away free books with a subscription, and you can get access to all of the articles onli-- nevermind.

Put a comment on this page if anyone ends up renaming this batch, and I will delete the old torrent after I make sure a new one is up.
