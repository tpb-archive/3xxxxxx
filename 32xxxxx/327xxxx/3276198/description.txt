"Picture It! 99 makes it much more fun to turn good pictures into great pictures, calendars, e-mail postcards, business flyers, and more" said Kingsley. "It comes with expanded photo-editing and enhancement capabilities which includes high-quality templates, project ideas and clip art. It's also a lot easier to use."
 
From simple tasks such as eliminating red-eye and fixing scratches to putting a friend on top of Mount Everest to shedding those last 10 pounds or swapping bodies, Picture It! 99 is the only software needed to edit and enhance personal photos with professional looking results - regardless of skill level.
 
With two CDs full of ideas and artwork, Picture It! inspires users to do more with personal photos than they ever thought possible. For example, users can create fantasy vacation photos and then e-mail them, with sound and music, to friends; create personalised photo calendars as gifts; or help kids create cards for their favourite sports team.
