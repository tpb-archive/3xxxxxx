Two of the most underrated adventure games ever, both Discworld games are based on Terry Pratchett's pun-filled fantasy Discworld series, in which the whole world is carried through space by a turtle, and idioms and puns do have a life of their own. As bumbling wizard Rincewind, prevent the Dragon from destroying the world in Discworld 1 and find a way to convince the disillusioned Death to resume his day job in the sequel. Both games have great humor (although dialogues drag on at times), and some of the most devious but logical puzzles ever designed. Famed Monty Python veteran Eric Idle's performance as the voice of Rincewind is flawless, althought some dialogues are very long-winded to the point of frustrating. Clever puzzles and hilarious animations, however, more than make up for it. Two thumbs up!
