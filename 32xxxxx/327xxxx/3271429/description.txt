Samma GTA 2 som på Rockstar/Classics, men eftersom det inte går att ladda ner därifrån så har jag gjort en torrent.

--------------------------------------
GTA2 - README FIRST!
--------------------------------------


WARNING
--------------
This version of GTA2 is modified from its original version to enable support for modern PC's
and current Microsoft Windows(R) platforms. However, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that
GTA2 will work correctly on your PC. Installation and execution of this software is entirely
at your own risk.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

- After downloading GTA2, unzip the file and double-click on the installer (GTA2.exe).

- The Install program will start; follow the on-screen install instructions and choose where you would like to install GTA2.

- GTA2 will then be installed and a program group created for you in "START > PROGRAMS > Rockstar Games > GTA2".

- You will NEED to run "AutoDetect" from the Program Menu BEFORE running the game for the first time.

- In AutoDetect you can choose your Rendering Engine (Method of Graphics Display). If your Graphics card supports 3D acceleration then please choose "Direct3D"; otherwise please choose "DirectDraw" or whatever other option appears in the drop-down menu. If you are unsure please choose "Direct3D" (you can always change it back later). 

- Once you are done with the AutoDetect, choose "Save" to save your settings. You can now run GTA2!

- Just click on "START > PROGRAMS > Rockstar Games > GTA2 > GTA2" to start. 


- Have Fun!
