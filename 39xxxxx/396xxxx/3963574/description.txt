My iPhone Ringtones, all 60 of em....
I did a 1st release after I found out how to make my own Ringtones for my iPhone using simple free tools that I found on Google.

All you have to do is unzip the file, you will then get a folder with 60 ringtones.  Simply add these to iTunes, sync your iPhone and you are good to go.  :0)

Some of the sounds clips are really for notifications like email etc. but unfortunately these are not currently user definable sounds at the moment!  Hark on at Apple to get these functions added!

Enjoy
