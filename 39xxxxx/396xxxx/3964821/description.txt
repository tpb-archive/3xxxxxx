Carl Sagan - The Demon-Haunted World - Science as a Candle in the Dark
 
http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Bookcassette/dp/1561006491

Carl Sagan muses on the current state of scientific thought, which offers him marvelous opportunities to entertain us with his own childhood experiences, the newspaper morgues, UFO stories, and the assorted flotsam and jetsam of pseudoscience. Along the way he debunks alien abduction, faith-healing, and channeling; refutes the arguments that science destroys spirituality, and provides a "baloney detection kit" for thinking through political, social, religious, and other issues.
