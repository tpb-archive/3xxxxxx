    Abstract: Certain classes of higher dimensional models suggest that the 
Casimir Effect is a candidate for the cosmological constant. In this paper we 
demonstrate that a sufficiently advanced civilization could, in principal, 
manipulate the radius of the extra dimension to locally adjust the value of the 
cosmological constant. This adjustment could be tuned to generate an 
expansion/contraction of spacetime around a spacecraft creating an exotic form of 
field-propulsion. Due to the fact that spacetime expansion itself is not 
restricted by relativity, a faster-than-light 'warp drive' could be created. 
Calculations of the energy requirements of such a drive are performed and an 
'ultimate' speed limit, based on the Planckian limits on the size of the extra 
dimensions is found.
