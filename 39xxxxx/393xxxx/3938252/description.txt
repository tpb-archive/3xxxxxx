An immensely popular series broadcast on PBS from 1978 to 1992, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY set a new bar for all courtroom dramas to come. Balancing suspense and satire as deftly as the scale of justice, Horace Rumpole, tirelessly defends the downtrodden while undressing the upper classes. A timeless mixture of comedy and drama, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY was one of television's most celebrated courtroom dramas. Flawlessly adapted by John Mortimer from his best-selling Edgar Award-winning novels, and starring the esteemed Leo McKern (A Man for All Seasons), this torrent includes all 42 episodes from the seven seasons of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY. The 1980 bonus film "Rumpole's Return," shown between seasons 2 & 3, is also included. 

NOTE: The extremely rare BBC One Play for Today "Rumpole of the Bailey" a.k.a "Rumpole and the Confession of Guilt" pilot episode (1975) is unfortunately not included here for download as it wasn't on the complete DVD set from which I ripped all of the other episodes. But fear not! You can watch this episode online in its entirety thanks to an upload of another user. Just copy and paste the web address found in the info file in this torrent into your browser and the video should start playing.

Enjoy and please seed!
