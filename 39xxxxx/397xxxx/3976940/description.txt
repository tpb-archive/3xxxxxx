Copy your files faster and easier

TeraCopy is a compact program designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible speed, providing the user a lot of features: 

Copy files faster. TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce seek times. Asynchronous copy speeds up file transfer between two physical hard drives. 

Pause and resume file transfers. Pause copy process at any time to free up system resources and continue with a single click. 

Error recovery. In case of copy error, TeraCopy will try several times and in the worse case just skips the file, not terminating the entire transfer. 

Interactive file list. TeraCopy shows failed file transfers and lets you fix the problem and recopy only problem files. 

Shell integration. TeraCopy can completely replace Explorer copy and move functions, allowing you work with files as usual. 

Full Unicode support.
