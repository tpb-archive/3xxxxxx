Four piece Finnish metal-bulldozer Diablo was born in the late 1990s. Diablo released its third album Eternium on the 19th of January 2004. It went straight to number 3 on the Finnish charts, staying for eight weeks on the Finnish Top 40. The band got awesome media interest. Most of the gigs were sold out and the forthcoming summer seems to be a busy time for the group. Diablo, Finland's brightest metal hope, is known as a super live act, capable of producing their enormous roar also on stage.

Eterniums 11 songs consist of ass-kicking down-tuned guitar riffs decorated with melodic sologuitar harmonies. Vocals are a combination of crunch and clean parts with great melodies. This kind of metal hasn┬┤t been available before. The hot chilisoup has been cooked by Diablo itself. Rainer (rhythm guitar & vocals) and Marko (solo guitar) are responsible for composing and writing the lyrics. The drummer Heikki is phenomenal young talent and the bass player Aadolf the long-hair show man of the band.
