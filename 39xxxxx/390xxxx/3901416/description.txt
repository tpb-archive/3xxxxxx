This is the story of Ferrari, his personal life and the way he started as a racing driver and then founded the Ferrari company.

Yes, this story is about the famous Ferrari sports cars, about the men himself who made Ferrari what it is today.

In the movie we see the old Enzo Ferrari tells the story of his life, his women, his children and the people he worked with.

This movie is pretty good, just a bit too long at some parts.

I'm a bit troubled with the way it ended, they should have done the ending more clear.

Watch it if you like the Ferrari cars.
