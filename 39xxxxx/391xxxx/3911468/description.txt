For those of You whom Downloaded this set and probably waiting for someone to seed it again. So heres a heads up. 

George Philipp Telemann - Tafelmusik (Complete) [4CD] 

When I Downloaded This I Got The Whole Thing ...Minus The First Song of The First Disc.  I Been Trying My Damndest To Get That Track, hoping someone whom hasnt logged into here in a long time will do so and provide me a peer to downoad it and so i left the torrent run for quite some time. Well it was worth a try. I suceeded in doing that with another 3 CD set. But this time it wasnt working that way in my favor. Well, For The Hell of It,i tried to play the file in various softwares to see how much of the song is there and Lo and behold the Whole song was indeed there.  I Used My Creative Soundblaster Smart recorder in the "What You hear" mode
to record it while it was playing. (dbPowerAMP Music Converter is software that will convert music, but not if it is a damaged file, but some damaged files will still play.) I Recorded it as a High Quality WAV file to preserve it. Then i used dbPowerAMP Music Converter to convert it to MP3 to conform to the rest of the 4 cd set. Cool, Huh? It really bugs the hell out of me to get stuff with a song missing or damaged but sometimes we can overcome. I never found the remainder of the cover art, but thats ok...at least the front cover is here.
Enjoy.

If your like me and you already have this 4 cd set downloaded from somebody else, you can download it and then when your dialog box comes up, just uncheck the songs you already have and just download the ones you are missing.
