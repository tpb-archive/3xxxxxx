_____________________________________________________________Summary__

In the Indonesian province of Aceh, journalist William Nessen gained
a general?s trust and patrolled with the military. He fell in love
with a local translator, who worked secretly for the independence
movement. Nessen lived for months on the frontlines with GAM
independence guerrillas, was hunted by the military, imprisoned for
40 days and twice expelled from the country. Days after Nessen?s
marriage in Aceh, the security forces kidnapped and killed his
"best man", an outspoken human rights activist.

Through the lens of Nessen?s personal and powerful experiences
emerges the first film to tell the story of Aceh?s rebellion
against Indonesian rule.

The Black Road takes us on a journey deep inside Southeast Asia?s
hottest conflict - a conflict that may well decide the fate of
Indonesia, Australia?s closest neighbour and the world?s largest
Muslim nation. The people of Aceh fight for political independence;
Indonesia wants to keep the gas-rich province firmly under its
control.

The film brings us directly to the battlefields and burnt-out
villages of the province. We step into the lives and experience
the deaths of Aceh?s GAM guerrillas, its human rights activists
and ordinary farmers. We march with demonstrators and witness the
massacres that follow. Acknowledging a hundred-year history of
resistance to outside rule, the film focuses on the past three
years of escalating fighting, martial law and the banning of all
foreign journalists.

The film begins and ends with extraordinary scenes that no other
journalist has captured: the conflict continuing even in the rubble
of the tsunami. But there is some laughter here too and the
possibility of healing. It?s a story about how people endure,
struggle and maintain their dignity against the odds.

The Aceh conflict raises a crucial political question, which is the
subtext of the film: Is political freedom for a long-suffering people
more important than the right of a country to hold its disparate
parts together?

The Black Road is also a startling account of a Nessen?s painful
four-year journey of self-discovery, as he is pulled deeper into the
conflict and the tragedy and the personal lives of the Acehnese.
Nessen increasingly wrestles with the dilemmas of remaining an
observer in a place of terrible misdeeds.
