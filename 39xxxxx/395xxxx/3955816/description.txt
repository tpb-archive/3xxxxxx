# Welcome to the xbtit v.2 #
#--------------------------#
Just a few words about this piece of script and some credits wink.gif

The script is released under modified BSD, which mean you can freely use and
modify it (read LICENSE for more info)

xbtit is a complete rewrite of our BtiTracker base code. Every file has been changed, it is impracticable to list all the changes here. xbtit is the concentration of biteam.org's years of experience developing, hacking, and operating, tracker software. We are confident you are going to enjoy this release

To upgrade your modified Btit 1.4.x to xbtit it is necessary to upgrade your current db using upgrade.php (not included in the standard package) and then reapply your hacks to the new xbtit code. Although xbtit has a hack template system designed to make the application of hacks easy, none of our 1.4.x hacks have yet been packaged for xbtit, these will arrive in time as the community adopts the new code

xbtit has two bittorrent tracker systems - a PHP tracker and xbtt. The PHP tracker is designed for platforms without access to the system root, or where your tracker is not expected to run with greater than 5-10,000 peers. A PHP tracker can generate a high volume of TCP traffic, potentially millions of hits per day on port 80, you have been cautioned. The second tracker system is xbtt by Olaf van der Spek. xbtt is an efficient C++ tracker capable of running millions of peers at very low overhead, you are recommended in all cases to use the xbtt system

The tracker is professionally supported for a small fee at http://www.xbtit.com where you will also find private hacks, modifications, and styles

The opensource free support forum is http://www.btiteam.org

# CREDITS #
#---------#
The script in this version is very very different than the original one, but we are pleased to leave the credits from previous version from which this is born wink.gif

This tracker's origin was as a frontend for DeHackEd's tracker aka phpBTTracker (now almost extinct)

We aimed to make a nice user interface and a good admin tool at the same time. Some code and some ideas came from other trackers and projects:
- torrentbits (http://www.torrentbits.org - dead)
- torrenttrader (http://www.torrentrader.org)
- bytemoonsoon (deadlink)
- Tbdev: CoLdFuSiOn (http://www.tbdev.net)
- xbtt: Olaf van der Spek (http://xbtt.sourceforge.net)
- phpmailer (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer)
- smf (http://www.simplemachines.org/)
- bTemplate: Brian Lozier (http://www.massassi.com/bTemplate)

The rest has been coded, designed, and thought up from scratch
