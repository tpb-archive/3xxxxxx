Adrianopolis - 2047

  It is the golden age in mankind's evolution. For the first time in history,
  countries with significant resources have united under one World Union.
  In this utopian society, "survival of the fittest" takes its next inevitable
  step. Only the elite are deemed worthy to live under the World Union banner
  - the smartest, healthiest, and wealthiest. Forsaking the altruistic
  tendencies that have crippled individual development and economic progress
  in the past, the World Union has ushered in an unprecedented era of
  self-interest and fulfillment. Prosperity is a science, sex is
  entertainment, disease and capital crime are non-existent, and the future
  has never looked better.

  But beneath a perfect world lies an unspeakable truth. That truth is ready
  to surface.

  A World Union citizen is murdered in Russia, one of the few remaining Rogue
  States. This murder oddly coincides with the accidental death of a prominent
  professor in Adrianopolis, an important border town between the World Union
  and Russia. Peace Officer Phoenix Wallis is assigned to lead the
  investigation of the murder. Still young and inexperienced, she will soon
  make discoveries beyond her wildest imagination, as skilled hackers and
  subversive characters begin taking an inexplicable interest in Phoenix.
  Her investigation reveals enigmatic clues that lead her deeper and deeper
  into a mystery that challenges not only her case, but her very beliefs in
  the worldview she has sworn to protect.

  Join Phoenix in her exciting 3D adventure. Culpa Innata welcomes you to the
  World Union.
