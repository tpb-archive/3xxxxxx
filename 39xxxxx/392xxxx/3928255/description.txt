          Dirt is Alice in Chains' major artistic statement and the closest they ever came to  
          recording a flat-out masterpiece. It's a primal, sickening howl from the depths of   
          Layne Staley's heroin addiction, and one of the most harrowing concept albums ever   
          recorded. Not every song on Dirt is explicitly about heroin, but Jerry Cantrell's    
          solo-written contributions (nearly half the album) effectively maintain the thematic 
          coherence -- nearly every song is imbued with the morbidity, self-disgust, and/or    
          resignation of a self-aware yet powerless addict. Cantrell's technically limited but 
          inventive guitar work is by turns explosive, textured, and queasily disorienting,    
          keeping the listener off balance with atonal riffs and off-kilter time signatures.   
          Staley's stark confessional lyrics are similarly effective, and consistently         
          miserable. Sometimes he's just numb and apathetic, totally desensitized to the       
          outside world; sometimes his self-justifications betray a shockingly casual          
          amorality; his moments of self-recognition are permeated by despair and suicidal     
          self-loathing. Even given its subject matter, Dirt is monstrously bleak, closely     
          resembling the cracked, haunted landscape of its cover art. The album holds out      
          little hope for its protagonists (aside from the much-needed survival story of       
          "Rooster," a tribute to Cantrell's Vietnam-vet father), but in the end, it's redeemed
          by the honesty of its self-revelation and the sharp focus of its music.              
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
