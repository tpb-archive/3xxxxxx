Each .rar-result represents the first rar-file for each of the tree dvds included in the ""Elvis 68 Comeback Special Deluxe Edition"". Note: ""By Wladimir"" and ""ByWlad"" is the same uploader:

Search string nr one:
Comwback'68 By Wladimir 1 part01 rar

Search string nr two:
Comeback'68 By Wladimir 2 part01 rar

Search string nr three:
Comeback'68 ByWlad 3 part01 rar


For each search, click on the link to R.a.p.i.d.l.i.b.r.a.r.y. On that page you will find the full linklist for downloading from M.e.g.a.u.p.l.o.a.d.

GOOD LUCK! :-)

Ps. The REALLY FULL ""Elvis 68 Comeback Special Deluxe Edition"" includes tree DVD9 cd:s. I have not found these. "
