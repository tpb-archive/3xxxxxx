George Khan proud Pakistani and chip shop owner rules his family with a rod of iron. He thinks he's raising his seven children to be respectable Pakistani's - but this is Salford in the North of England, in 1971.
For the seven kids of George Khan, life is one long compromise. Tomboy Meenah prefers playing footie to wearing a Sari, hippie Saleem pretends to be studying engineering when he's really at art school, heart throb Tariq has got a reputation as a local Casanova, and Sajid hasn't even been circumcised yet!
In the Khan's cramped terrace house with its scant indoor plumbing, anarchy erupts on a daily basis. East is East is the hilarious story of what happens when two cultures collide within one family.
