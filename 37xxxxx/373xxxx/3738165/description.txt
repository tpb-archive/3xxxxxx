Fresh out of prison, Git rescues a former best friend (now living with Git\'s girlfriend) from a beating at the hands of loan sharks. He\'s now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It\'s a tougher assignment than it seems: Git\'s a novice, Bunny\'s prone to rash acts, Frank doesn\'t want to be found (and once he\'s found, he has no money), and maybe Tom\'s planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there\'s the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What\'s a decent and stand-up lad to do?.
