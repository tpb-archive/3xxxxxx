isn\\\'t the newest version either. So double fuck for him.

SCENERS: CHOOSE YOUR FUCKING SIDE: P2P or SCENE
DON\\\'T BE PART OF BOTH.

IF YOURE A P2P\\\'ER YOU CAN\\\'T HELP THE SCENE,
ONLY MAKE IT UNSAFE.

IF YOURE A SCENER GET SOME FUCKING PATIENCE,
OR LEAVE AND GO JOIN YOUR TORRENT COMMUNITIES.


FAQ:

p2p\\\'er: what the fuck is the problem?
- the problem is you use p2p and you can easily be busted, thereby getting your pc raided. what happens then?
police go through your family photos and finds your little mirc directory and takes a look at all the wonderful
log files you keep. so not only will you be busted.. others can follow. stop thinking of no one but yourself, dick.

scener: so what.. my sites are slow, torrents are much faster!
- then go use torrents, but leave the scene! see above.

scener: i don\\\'t normally use torrents, it\\\'s just.. i can\\\'t find xyz anywhere. i promise, i didn\\\'t seed or anything!
- \\\"site request xyz\\\", - \\\"but no one can fill it...\\\", well then you leave the scene. thank god and save the rest of us.
good thing you\\\'re obviously on so low rank sites. you better quit now.

scener->p2p/p2p->scener: but it\\\'s important to give back. share with people. otherwise none of use would be able to download anything!
- WRONG. what are you, nuts? that\\\'s not how you \\\"give back\\\"! as for supporting p2p, you\\\'re a dumbnut fuck if you sit around
waiting to get busted just so \\\"everyone else can download\\\", lol. hahaha.

ANY FUCKING QUESTIONS P2P LOVERS? Now go fuck yourselves...

PS: Going from scene to p2p? Couldn\\\'t care less. Going from p2p to scene? Go home!

---=== DONE ===---

If you feel like you\\\'ve been cheated, \\\"hey, this nfo wasn\\\'t that great. it\\\'s just one stupid p2per. he\\\'s not even on any of my sites\\\",
well.. first of all, congratulations. second of all, it\\\'s one less p2p in the scene and I don\\\'t care how few sites they\\\'re on, if they\\\'re
p2p, then it\\\'s out. see ya.

You gotta love sweden, right? :)

I blame their love of customsubs for bringing in p2ps, but i shouldn\\\'t scream like that. I have no proof, it\\\'s just my own opinion.


one last thing...
SCENEBAN -BROTHERS. lol, how big of a credit whore can you get? seriously...

the great thing about x264, hddvd/bluray releases and hdtv is that it will eventually clear up the scene.
when 720p hdtv is standard, there will be no more \\\"mistagged pdtv/dsr\\\". with x264 rules saying releases should be
in a mkv container, no more custom creditwhores. just release youre shitty subs in a little 1mb file. then people
can mux it into the desired release and enjoy your subs.

PPS: Welcome back to DocuTV (SVTV) ;) let\\\'s see what new name you make up when you\\\'re scenebanned again.

I wish the scene a great summer! Enjoy the sun, have some drinks and keep it oldschool!
