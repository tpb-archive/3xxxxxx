LightMachine is a plugin for performing all kinds of light
          adjustments in photos. It combines shadow/highlight, virtual
            lighting and color-based correction tools for performing
         sophisticated corrections without the need for time-consuming
       selections and layer stacks. LightMachine can correct brightness,
       contrast and saturation in specific image areas independently from
          each other. It lets you correct photos taken under bad light
        conditions or with bad camera settings and achieve results that
       rival photos taken under the best circumstances. LightMachine can
        be used in dozens of graphics applications including Photoshop,
       Paint Shop Pro, IrfanView, Photoshop Elements, PhotoImpact, Photo
         -Paint and Fireworks. LightMachine can be applied to 8bit and
                               16bit RGB images.
