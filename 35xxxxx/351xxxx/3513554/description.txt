This version of Juiced is built specifically for PSP, with unique multiplayer games and and an expansion on the crew and pink-slip racing features. The game was built from the ground up on PSP, with new cars, tracks, characters and game modes. The built-in wireless connectivity on the PSP lends itself to expanding the multi-player options, including multiplayer crew races, pink slip racing and the all new ?Eliminator? mode where the slowest driver per lap is removed from the competition, and the winner is the last one left in the race.
