A television program is interupted 
by a news network announcing that 
three meteors have hit the United States, 
France and China. At first it seems 
natural but after interviews by 
scientists and eyewitness seems to 
suggest that it is not. 

Three more meteors are coming and the 
various Earth governments combine 
forces to stop them.
