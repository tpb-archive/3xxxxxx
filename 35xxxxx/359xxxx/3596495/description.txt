Superior ZIP Support

ZIP Support PowerArchiver offers superior ZIP format support compared to other archivers. Here are the highlights:

    * Support for unlimited file size and unlimited number of files in ZIP archives
    * Support for advanced Deflate64 method providing higher compression ratios
    * ZIP AES support (both PkZip 5.1 and WZ 9.0 standards supported)
    * Fast and strong compression and decompression
    * Multiple disk spanning, with support for unlimited span sizes

7-Zip Compression

7-Zip is an advanced compression format featured in PowerArchiver 2006. It is an open source format, providing an open architecture and high compression ratio. 7-Zip outperforms ZIP, ACE and even RAR in many tests. However, 7-Zip\'s greatest strength is that it is not controlled by any organization or individual, but by an open source LGPL project to which anyone can contribute. More information on 7-Zip and its superior compression can be found at 7-Zip.org.
