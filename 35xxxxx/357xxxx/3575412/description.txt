PLOT OUTLINE :

From the biggest festival to the smallest church social,
Kenny Smyth delivers porta-loos to them all. Ignored and
unappreciated, he is one of the cogs in society's machinery;
a knight in shining overalls taking care of business with his
faithful 'Splashdown' crew. Follow Kenny as he tackles every
septic challenge that comes his way, culminating in a pilgrimage
to that Mecca of waste management, the International Pumper and
Cleaner Expo in Nashville Tennessee - or as Kenny affectionately
calls it, "Poo HQ". With fly-on-the-wall honesty and wit, 'KENNY'
lifts the lid on one of Australia's roughest diamonds as he juggles
family tensions, fatherhood and sewage with charm, humour and unflinching
dignity. "It takes a certain kind of person to do what I do... No-one's
ever impressed; no-one's ever fascinated... If you're a fireman, all
the kids will want to jump on the back of the truck and follow you to a
fire. There's going to be no kids willing to do that with me. So, I don't
do it to impress people - it's a job, it's my trade, and I actually think
I'm pretty good at it." - Kenny Smyth Part philosopher, part comedian
and all heart, KENNY is living proof that in sewage, like life, the best
will always rise to the top.
