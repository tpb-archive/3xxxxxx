Kronos WideScreen (1957)

Summary
Scientists investigate what appears to be a meteorite that crashes into the ocean. After a few days and nights of mysterious lights and noises, a giant machine comes out of the ocean. The machine is the creation of an alien race, that is trying to syphon energy from earth. A true classic, in that it is so different from anything in the time period. To this day, nothing else has come out like it.


A giant asteroid nearly five miles wide crashes into the ocean near Mexico. A trio of scientists, led by Les Gaskell, investigate, and discover a giant machine. Meanwhile, a colleague of the scientists has been possessed by an alien electricity, and is controlling the actions of a 100-foot-tall robot, which is heading for Los Angeles and destroying all in its path.
