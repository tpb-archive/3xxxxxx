Okay. Wasn't going to offer this file. But then i thought that the world needs to hear this stuff. Hell, it might save something, someone from playing another crappy Justin Timberlake album. It's a loose blues session, with a great cast of musicians. Song #6 is 19 minutes of some of the rawest, meanest blues you'll ever hear. Which is why i'm torrenting the .shn files, not crappy mp3, for the full audio sounds. And people, this jam session is 37 years old, so have some respect for its brilliance. I've got many more similar .shn shows if you want to do a trade.
