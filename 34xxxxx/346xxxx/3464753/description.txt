New Zeeland Comedy Series

This New Zealand gem of a comedy follows the horrible antics of old, grumpy school-teacher, Mr.Gormsby, as he sets about trying to discipline a classroom of unruly school children in the most unbelievable ways imaginable. The humour sometimes descends into uninspiring childish toilet humour, and it's not immune to getting laughs out of the mentally-challenged, but thanks to a priceless deadpan performance from David McPhail as the title character, this crude, dry and utterly hilarious take on New Zealand school life is wickedly un-PC comedy brilliance. We don't get much New Zealand television here in Australia, but this one's a gem. 8/10
