This is a repaired AVI that I got from another torent that wasn't being seeded, It has one or two video screw ups that clean up pretty quickly, and the sound stays synced up thruout the entire film.

Plot Summary for 
The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human (1999) 
An anthropologist from an alien planet provides voice-over commentary for a documentary look at human courtship, mating, and reproduction: "complex, perverse, tragically beautiful: the earthbound human." The commentary gets some of the details comically wrong (explaining the slap on a newborn's back: "they don't like the looks of the child so they beat it"), but gets right the overall idea. We follow Billy and Jenny from their meeting at a club, initial misunderstandings, his losing her phone number, finally connecting, walks on the beach, soulful talks, meeting each other's parents, friends' advice, and the gradual taking of the relationship to new levels.
