Players take on the role of the young hero Bolt, a quick thinking agent who has discovered some friendly, highly advanced robots called Tokobots during his explorations of ancient ruins. With the help of the loyal Tokobots, Bolt will reveal mysteries and save the world from a horrible plot, as the Tokobots faithfully follow him on his journey, helping him to avoid obstacles, traps and enemies, by working together to create team combos. During these actions, the Tokobots team up to take on different combinations in order to simulate everything from a ladder that Bolt climbs to wings that allow him to fly over large obstacles. The player will have to use strategy and skill to create these team combos in order to complete each level and succeed in the game.
