This is the original movie that was remake by Hollywood with Keanu Reeves and 
Sandra Bullock... called "The Lake of House"... that is coming on 
jun2006!
Eun-joo moves out of her house "Il Mare", leaving behind a Christmas 
card for the eventual new owner of the house in 1999. In it she asks 
him/her to forward any mail of hers to her new address in the city. 
It is 1997 and Sung-hyun, the first owner of "Il Mare" is moving in 
and finds in his mailbox the Christmas card from Eun-joo. Thinking it
 was a joke, Sung-hyun leaves her a letter telling her so and reminds
 her that its 1997 not 1999. Eventually the two realize that they are 
separated by two years of time but can somehow communicate through the
 mailbox and begin to form a friendship through their letters...

It's a wonderfull movie!
