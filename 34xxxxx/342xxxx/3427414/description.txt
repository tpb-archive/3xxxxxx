Description
After being humiliated yet again by Crash Bandicoot at the end of Crash Twinsanity, 
Cortex returns to his evil scheming in his dilapidated Iceberg Lair. He stumbles 
across a newspaper article regarding the closure of Ebeneezer Von Clutch's condemned 
racing arena. He hatches a sinister plan to challenge Crash to a seemingly friendly 
race competition... with plans of crushing the hapless bandicoot under the ruins of 
the hazardous racetrack! Will the evil doctor's plans be the end of our furry hero?
In Crash Tag Team Racing, players can "clash" their car with an opponent's mid-race 
to make a super-car equipped with a powerful turret gun. When clashed, players can 
either get behind the wheel and drive, or fire an onboard weapon. Each character 
has his or her own uniquely deadly 360Ú rotating turret. Players can continue the 
action out of the car where they can explore the entire world on foot and collect 
upgrades for their cars and unlock bonus tracks.
