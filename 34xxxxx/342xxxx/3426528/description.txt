This torrent is for the discriminating listener who doesn?t believe all music has to sound the same. There is nothing on here that resembles Louie Louie, Midnight Hour or anything by someone named *DOG. Some of the music is dissonant and atonal but so is feedback and Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan didn?t have a problem with that. If you are addicted to top 40 and intolerant of sounds that you might not recognize stay away from this torrent as you will hate it. If, on the other hand, you have an open mind about music/sound and are curious about some of the influences of people like Frank Zappa, Robert Fripp and any number of other avant-garde composer geniuses and artists who dabble in twelve tone or serialist music you will find this set interesting.

show a little class and stick around to seed for a while so others can get it too.
Seeding these for days at a time watching folks run away after they?ve got the shows really blows! If the 1st couple of people completing bugger off I will switch to SUPERSEED MODE effectively forcing anyone with 80 or 90 percent to wait untill everyone with 5 and 6 percent catches up with you and that can mean a very long and unnecessary wait... so be good, play nice and help spread the music!!
