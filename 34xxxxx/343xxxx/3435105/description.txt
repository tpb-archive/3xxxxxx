For the most I have done my small part to get this out. I may or may not have violated Digg's TOS, but I really don't care at this point in time. What I do care about if the knowledge that this dvd holds and the word that it is trying to spread. I try to take everything that is said too me from either side of the fence with a grain of sand. But the information contained in this dvd has none the less turned my stomach and swayed my vote for what is right in this world or for the people that live in it. I am not a terrorist nor do I have any affliation with ANY form or branch of anti-government group. I am one person with a free mind and soul and I would like it to stay that way, no matter what the cost. I hope that most of you feel the same. So please take this movie and watch it all the way through. You can come to your own conclusion at the end as I have. Please don't kill the messenger only hear the message that I bring and use it to further your own soul and well being. Now after that here is some file information.
