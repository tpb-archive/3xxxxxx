Dream Passport 3 Chinese V2(EX)
Released By Jeff.Ma

The most powerful dreamcast release is here!

this is not a single game disk
but a game collection

i made many cool stuff and 14 games on this single CD

such as VMU Saves, VMU Minigames, Game Midis, and so on.
that means you can visit a website, listen Game Midis, download a VMU save or VMU game directly from this CD without going online.

and, the most unbelievable thing is:
you can find 14 games on this disk
here is a list

01: Ikaruga
