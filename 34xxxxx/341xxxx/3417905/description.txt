Description:

International award-winning filmmaker Kevin P. Miller (LET TRUTH BE THE BIAS; 
THE PROMISED LAND) unveils the worldwide threat to medical freedom of choice 
in WE BECOME SILENT: The Last Days of Health Freedom.' 

WE BECOME SILENT details the ongoing attempts by multinational pharmaceutical 
interests, giant food companies, and government agencies to limit the public's
access to herbs, vitamins and other therapies. The film highlights the U.S. 
government's complicity in suppressing the truth about the effectiveness of 
alternative/complementary medicines, and outlines the international plan to 
eliminate freedom of choice in healthcare through the work of the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission. 


Narrated by Dame Judi Dench, the noted UK actress who has won multiple Golden 
Globe awards and dozens of other honors throughout her prestigious career, WE 
BECOME SILENT is a powerful statement about the dominance of multinational 
corporations over personal freedoms. The film describes the ominous 
bureaucratic shadow being cast by Codex, in concert with the World Trade 
Organization and others - and the challenges consumers face in trying to repel 
these monoliths from their daily lives. 

WE BECOME SILENT features the only known video from inside a Codex meeting, 
exclusive interviews with delegates to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration officials, two U.S. Congressmen, actor Mel Gibson,
and consumer activists from throughout the world.
