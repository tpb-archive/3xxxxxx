`?•????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????????????????? ?????????????'



Welcome to the revolution in GameCube emulators! SNES9X is by far the most

complete and accurate Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator to date.

Taking full power of the ATi-GX chipset and packed full of features that are

to die for after playing your games you'll never want to come back to

reality.



SNES9X is a very popular open source emulator mainly for the PC platform, but

has seen many ports to other consoles such as the Nintendo DS, Microsoft XBOX

and now thanks to SoftDev the Nintendo GameCube! This is a straight port and

is not based on any previous SNES emulators that have existed for the

GameCube. You can get more information on SNES9X here from the below URL.

|0O×øo·                        PARTIAL PKZIP SUPPORT                  ·oø×O0|

`?•????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????????????????? ?????????????'



The Zip support in the emulator is courtesy of the zlib library. Currently,

it supports only the Inflate method.



The good news is that this is by far the most common zip method!



You should note also that this implementation assumes that the first file

in each archive is the required rom in smc/fig format.



In an attempt to save you time, we recommend using 7-Zip as the compressor,

as it gives a gain of 5-25% better compression over standard zips.



To use 7-Zip compression on either linux or windows, use the following,



  7za a -tzip -mx=9 myrom.zip myrom.smc

|0O×øo·                         SETUP & INSTALLATION                  ·oø×O0|

`?•????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????????????????? ?????????????'



Unzip the archive into a folder with at least one SNES ROM image. Images must

be in the Super Magicom (SMC) or FIG format. Generally, all images you find

will be in this format, but if you run across one that isn't please download

RTOOL which will allow you to convert the image into SMC format.



After this you're going to need to inject a ROM image into the emulator

before you can get it up and running. To be fair to everyone including those

of you who do not have a spare DVD we've adopted this approach.



SNESGX supports ROM images up to 8Mb (64 megabit) from DVD, or 4Mb (32 megabit)

in a dol, so you shouldn't have to worry about what size the games are before you

load them, but since the saving and loading of your progress is based on the

internal ROM name (header) itself you may want to check to see if the ROM header

is intact, but don't worry about this as most ROM images have correct headers.



Next, for all you non-commandos out there here is a quick guide on how to

create the initial DOL (GameCube Executable File) you will need to load on

your system. If you're already familiar with the Command Line Interface (CLI)

simply skip to step 6. Note when I use '' to only type what is in between

them.



  (1) Unzip archive into c:snes

  (2) Put GAME.SMC into c:snes

      GAME.SMC can be any game you want

  (3) Click on the START MENU then RUN and type in 'CMD' and press ENTER

  (4) Type 'C:' press ENTER

  (5) Type 'CDSNES' press ENTER

  (6) Type 'sgxi.exe GAME.SMC GAME.DOL' press ENTER



Now you will have a GAME.DOL file which you can burn onto a DVD and/or stream

to your GameCube. If you're unfamiliar with streaming and/or burning a DVD

please refer to the Mod That Cube -FAQ- for further instructions.

Once the DOL file is loaded you will be presented with the configuration

screen where you can adjust many options before you start the gameplay.

Additionally, if at any time your heart desires to alter these options, save

your game or load a new ROM image simply press the Z and the left trigger

button (at the same time) and you'll be brought back to this menu.



To leave the options at their default and continue to play the game simply

press the 'A' button and enjoy!

`?•????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????????????????? ?????????????'



To load the configuration menu press Z + LEFT TRIGGER at the same time and

you can save/load you current progress, load a new game from DVD and/or tweak

the emulators options.



Save Game Manager



  Will bring you into the management system where you can Save or Load your

  current game progress. You may SAVE you game progress at any time, but when

  loading your SAVE please reload your game, load your SAVE and then play the

  game. If you try loading your SAVE after the game starts you may run into

  some nasty problems.



Load New ROM



  If you're tired of playing your current game pick this option

  so you can browse the current DVD in the GameCube and select a new game to

  play.



Pad Configuration



  Don't like the way the controller is setup (mapped)? Simply pick this

  option and you can chose which button does what.



Emulator Options



  Here you can tweak some of the internal Snes9x emulator options



  Sound Echo



    Will add a pseudo echo effect to all sounds creating a more

    in depth gameplay experience.



  Reverse Stereo



    Change the audio output from LEFT and RIGHT to RIGHT and LEFT.



  Transparency



    Some games, such as Terranigma (a great role playing game only

    released in the United Kingdom) include transparency effects. Use this

    option to turn these off or on.



  FPS Display



    This option will display the Frames Per Second (FPS) in the bottom left

    hand corner so you can see how accurate the graphics are being displayed

    on the screen.



  Sound Sync



    Snes9x allows for synchronising the sound with the emulator speed.



  Timer



    The original timing in Snes9x is based on the vertical blank counter.

    You now also have the option to use a crude clock timer, which may help

    playing PAL50 on a 60hz output.



  Reset Emulator



    Perform a soft-reset on the Snes9x core.



PSO/SD Reload



  If you're using Phantasy Star Online (PSO) or SD-Load (SD) to boot SNESGX

  from then you can use this option to go back to the loading menu to select

  another GameCube executable (DOL/ELF) file to load.



View Credits



  You can view the credits for the emulator. The credits can also be viewed

  at the end of this document.



ROM Information



  Here you can double check the ROM information. If SRAM == 0, you have no

  save available.



Stop DVD Motor



  As it says, once you know you're in for the long haul, save your drive

  motor by switching it off

The Snes9X program normally expects to have constant access to a hard drive,

to write out the SRAM data at a user specified interval. As we don't have

this luxury on the Gamecube, the onus is in the user to save at regular

intervals.



We've been working closely with shagkur (libogc author) to track down the

problems in the memcard functions.



This release now has 24-7 memcard access for most users. Indeed, the test

team have left a gamecube running for two days to ensure that the card

still functions and saves/loads as expected.



We can't use the latest WIP, as this breaks a lot of other things - so the

source release includes the changes we made to libogc. You use those at

your own risk !
