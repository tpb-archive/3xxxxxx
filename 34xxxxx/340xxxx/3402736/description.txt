About The Game :

The German orders to capture of Moscow in October 1941 specified the use of 51
divisions, including 13 panzer divisions, to encircle the city. As the Germans
closed in on the capital, the fighting got fiercer and more desperate. The
delay of the German forces after Smolensk left little time for the drive
to Moscow before the onset of winter. And while both German and Russian High
Commands were well aware of this, nevertheless, 'Operation Typhoon' went
ahead as planned. The attack was costly and first bogged down in endless mud,
making the roads impassable. Next, the offensive was literally 'frozen in its
tracks' when the harsh Soviet winter set in. The Germans were not provided with
winter clothing, and their vehicles and equipment were similarly not prepared.
Yet despite all this, they reached the western suburbs, barely 17 km from the
Kremlin, but before they ever encircled the city Soviet reinforcements arrived.
Some of these new Russian troops were Siberian divisions, equipped and trained
for winter fighting.

Can you capture Moscow in the face of the strengthening Red Army and the onset of
the bitter Russian Winter?
