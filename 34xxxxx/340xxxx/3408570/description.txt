Liberia, a nation burdened by its past. America, a nation with no memory at 
all." In Liberia, the summer of 2003 was pure insanity. A rebel army attempts 
to overthrow a government run by an indicted war criminal. Two armies engage 
in the final battle of a decade long civil war. Hundreds of innocent civilians 
die from mortar shells launched from afar and thousands more suffer hunger 
while the soldiers, mostly teenagers, keep the capital city under siege. The 
nation prays that America, the world's sole superpower, will put an end to the 
violence. Conceived in Washington in the early 1800s, its constitution written 
at Harvard, its founding fathers freed slaves who returned to Africa, Liberia 
is the one country in the world worthy of the title, Made in America. By the 
year 2000, Liberia, once considered the gem of Africa, was ranked last in the 
world for quality of life.
