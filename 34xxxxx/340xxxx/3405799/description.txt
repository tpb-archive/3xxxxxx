               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          In over 20 years, AC/DC have never changed their minimalist, bone-crunching hard     
          rock. During their first ten years, that wasn't a problem, since they were still     
          finding ways to expand and subvert the pattern, but ever since For Those About to    
          Rock, they've had trouble coming up with consistent material. Consequently, their    
          performances tended to be a little lazy and their records didn't deliver a reliable  
          knockout punch. Released in 1990, The Razor's Edge showed some signs of life, and    
          their comeback culminated in the Rick Rubin-produced Ballbreaker. What makes         
          Ballbreaker different than the albums AC/DC churned out during the '80s is simple -- 
          it's a matter of focus. Although "Hard as a Rock" comes close, there aren't any songs
          as immediately memorable as any of their '70s classics, or even "Moneytalks."        
          However, unlike any record since Back in Black, there are no bad songs on the album. 
          Surprisingly, Rubin's production is a bit too dry, lacking the muscle needed to make 
          the riffs sound truly earthshaking. Nevertheless, Angus Young's riffs are powerful   
          and catchy, showcasing every element that makes him one of hard rock and heavy       
          metal's greatest guitarists. Throughout the album, the band sounds committed and     
          professional, making Ballbreaker the best late-period AC/DC album to date.
