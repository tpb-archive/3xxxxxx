          If you are a fan of AC/DC then you simply have to own 'Jailbreak'. Sure it's short in
          length, but it is so full of good music that what it lacks in quantity it makes up   
          for in quality. The song 'Jailbreak' is AC/DC at it's best with Bon Scott's unique   
          and edgy vocals. Angus Young's guitar work is phenominal. 'You Aint' Got A Hold on   
          Me' shows where the band is heading with a more melodic rhythm and catchy chorus, and
          'Soul Stripper' shows where the band came from, with a really great blues vocal by   
          Bon. Another highlight of 'Jailbreak' is the cover of Them/Van Morrison's tune 'Baby 
          Please Don't Go'. The instantly recognizable guitar hook is great, and AC/DC takes   
          this classic and makes it their own.
