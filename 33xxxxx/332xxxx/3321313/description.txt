This extended Behind the Music details the tumultuous life and career of hard rock pioneer Dave Mustaine and his band, Megadeth. Kicked out of Metallica, the band he co-founded, in 1982, the guitarist/vocalist got his revenge by forming Megadeth. His mission statement for his new group: ....to be the fastest, utmost furious heavy metal band ever.... But if anybody embodied the philosophy -::live hard, play hard::- it was Mustaine, who battled heroin addiction for nearly 10 years. Five line-ups, 16 trips to rehab, one near-death experience, and more than 20 million albums later, Megadeth have more than made their mark in metal. Also included: -::too hot for MTV/VH1::- version of the video for -::Moto Psycho::-
