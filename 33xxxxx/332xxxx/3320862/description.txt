Here comes the lyrics to -::Moto Psycho::- .........................

Responsibility, an anchor around my neck
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho - time and time and time again I'm a
Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
