A documentary which refutes and debunks 'facts' made by Michael Moore in his hit film "Fahrenheit 9/11". 

America is asking if Fahrenheit 9/11 is a healthy dose of dissent, or shameful cowardice. If Moore really believes what he says, or if it's all about the money. Fahrenhype 9/11 plunges a big needle deep into Moore's methods and answers these questions, drawing both blood and bile. See how America has been lied to about the cause of 9/11. Lied to about the truth of Islamic fascism. Lied to about how best to make America safe.
