By Mark Farrell: "Several years ago, I had a run-in with a colleague who asked me why some people disliked some, if not all, Jews. Shortly thereafter, I decided to put together a video on DVD that would adequately describe the many reasons in an objective manner. My own understanding of this question--better deemed, ?The Question?--was answered many years prior to this due to my inquisitive nature.

After much work, I?ve finally been able to present an answer, and I feel the answer is intellectually invigorating, and might even get people to think for themselves. I can now share this answer in an objective manner, allowing information from various sides of the debate. For it is not simply the ?Radical Right? who dislike certain ideas emanating from some Jewish groups, but also the ?Militant Left,? some atheists, paleo-conservatives, neo-liberals, some Christians, some moderates, and others. Moreover, there is even a small segment of Jews who are also critical of some issues with respect to essentially Jewish mainstream groups. Why do these various groups dislike certain aspects of Jews? What ideas do they have, or share in common, that put them at odds with Jews en masse? My quest for an answer is best expressed in my newest video: ?Understanding Anti-Semitism: Why Do Some People Dislike Jews??
