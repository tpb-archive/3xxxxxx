The Doors returned to crunching, straightforward hard rock on an album that, despite |
          |yielding no major hit singles, returned them to critical favor with hip listeners. An|
          |increasingly bluesy flavor began to color the songwriting and arrangements,          |
          |especially on the party and booze anthem "Roadhouse Blues." Airy mysticism was still |
          |present on "Waiting for the Sun," "Queen of the Highway," and "Indian Summer"; "Ship |
          |of Fools" and "Land Ho!" struck effective balances between the hard rock arrangements|
          |and the narrative reach of the lyrics. "Peace Frog" was the most political and       |
          |controversial track, documenting the domestic unrest of late-'60s America before     |
          |unexpectedly segueing into the restful ballad "Blue Sunday." "The Spy," by contrast, |
          |was a slow blues that pointed to the direction that would fully blossom on L.A.      |
          |Woman.
