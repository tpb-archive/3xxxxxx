Overseer - Biography	by Johnny Loftus

U.K.-based DJ Overseer made a name for himself with concoctions that married the pomposity of heavy metal riffing to the bombastic bottom end of big beat. He first emerged on wax with the independent EPs Zeptastic (1996) and Hit the Tarmac (1998); Columbia Records took notice and signed him in late 1998. It wasn't long before his action-packed grooves were making their way into film and television productions (Any Given Sunday, Alias) and extreme-themed video games. The Everything Louder Than Everything Else EP appeared in 2000, after which nothing was heard from Overseer until 2002-2003, which proved to be a quite a fruitful period. Overseer scored the trailer for Matrix: Reloaded, and was included on the soundtrack to the extreme ski and board film The Prophecy. He wrote all the music for Animatrix, the animated companion to the hit film series, and also saw his music appear in a high-profile Mitsubishi ad campaign. Overseer also issued his first full-length LP, Wreckage. 


Overseer - Wreckage (2003) - Review	by William Ruhlmann

Rob Overseer is yet another in a series of DJs sitting in their basements in northern England (in this case, Leeds) with a lot of machines creating electronic dance music and ethereal soundscapes. If much of his debut album Wreckage sounds familiar to almost anyone who hears it, there are two reasons. One is that its collages of beats, sampled instruments, raps, and repeated chants are not unlike the work of Fatboy Slim and Moby, to name only the most well-known purveyors of the same style. And second, like those predecessors, Overseer has managed to place his tracks in a variety of media even before this album was released, making it something of a compilation of tracks already heard in commercials (particularly for liquor and automobiles), video games (Gran Turismo, Stuntman), television series (C.S.I.), and movies (Snatch, Any Given Sunday). (In some cases, the tracks have been used only in commercials for movies, not on the soundtracks themselves. For example, both "Supermoves" and "Insectocuter Dub" were only in the commercials for Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle of Life.) Overseer has a particular affection for 1970s-era heavy metal, particularly its fuzztone guitar effects, so that, for example, the middle section of "Horndog" is reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love." But he also calms things down in such tracks as "Aquaplane" and the concluding song, "Heligoland." Although the album has a running time over 76 minutes and that final song runs almost 27 minutes, that length is deceptive. After about six and a half ambient minutes, the track is reduced to the sound of a ringing telephone that then rings for the next 20 minutes until someone says, "Hello," and the album comes to an end. We listen so you won't have to. (The album contains occasional expletives, but it does not have a parental advisory sticker.)
