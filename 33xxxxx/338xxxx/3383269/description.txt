PvP

    * Battlegrounds
          o Battleground "holidays" have been added to Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin. Holidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning.

    * Cat Form - Ferocious Bite's damage per combo point has been increased. In addition, extra energy now converts to damage at a higher rate.

    * Cat Form - Rake's damage has been increased.

Hunters

    * Survival and Beast Master talent trees have undergone major revisions in an effort to give Hunters additional, viable choices when selecting talents.

    * Frost Trap - Updated tooltip to reflect duration of the Frost Trap Effect.

    * The resist rate for hunter traps is now based on the hunter's skill rather than the level of the trap.
    * Pet Abilities
          o Hunters now have the first round of pet customization available. New passive abilities include increased armor, stamina, Fire resistance, Frost resistance, Nature resistance, Shadow resistance, and Arcane resistance.
          o All Hunter pets have their abilities unlearned. Training points have been fully refunded. (Abilities the Hunter has learned to teach their pets have not been lost. For example, if you have the ability to teach your pets "Claw 3", you will still be able to do so in this patch. However, your pet will have to be taught this ability again by using the Beast Training interface.)
          o Hunter pets can now be untrained of all their skills from any beast trainer in the major cities. Similar to talents, untraining a specific pet scales up as you do it more times: 10 silver, 50 silver, 1 gold, 2 gold, 3 gold, etc., eventually stopping at 10 gold.
          o Training point costs for all abilities have been rebalanced. You'll now be able to use all your pet's training points with meaningful choices. To help make "hunting" pets more viable in more situations, the Growl ability is now free to all pets.

          o Bats, owls, and carrion birds can now learn the Screech ability, a fast single-target attack that also lowers the attack power of all enemies within melee range of the pet.
          o Cats can now learn Stealth. In addition to being unseen, they receive a damage bonus for their first attack coming out of stealth.
          o Scorpids can now learn Scorpid Poison. The poison deals Nature damage over time and stacks up to five times on a single enemy.
          o Wolves can now learn Furious Howl. The howl adds a flat amount of damage to all nearby party member's next attack (within 15 yards). 
    * Hunter pets now gain experience based on the level difference between them and their target rather than the difference between the Hunters and their target. This will make it much easier to level up a low level pet. Keep in mind that the Hunter must still kill creatures from which he/she will gain experience.
    * The tooltips for quick Hunter shots have been updated to show them as instant abilities.
    * Feign death is no longer resisted by players.

    * You can cancel melee combat while mind controlling by clearing the target, like you can normally.
    * Blackout - Fixed a bug where rank 2 of the talent wasn't giving a chance to stun.

    * The fire damage from the Blazefury Medallion and the Gutgore Ripper's effect should no longer immediately break Gouge.

    * Succubus pets will be smarter about when to use Seduction.
    * Succubus pets can now autocast Lesser Invisibility.
    * Fixed a bug where Fear and Curse of Recklessness, when used together, would prevent targets from casting spells.
    * Fixed a bug where Soul Link and Power Word: Sheild, when used together, would heal the Warlock instead of splitting or absorbing damage.
    * Demon Armor - The armor increase will now stack together with Scrolls of Protection.
    * The Improved Drain Mana talent no longer does additional damage from plus damage items. This bonus damage was unintended and was a bug. 

Warriors

    * Deflection - Will now increase parry chance when using Fist Weapons.
    * Retaliation - Will now cause a maximum of 30 retaliatory strikes in 15 seconds. In addition, retaliatory strikes will not be possible while stunned.

    * Sweeping Strikes will now ignore dead targets, and will ignore PvP enabled targets if you are not PvP enabled 

Items

    * We have determined that the defense statistic was being applied to items too liberally, causing those items to be stronger than they should have been relative to other items of the same level with different effects. As a result, we have reduced the amount of defense points on all items with bonuses to defense by approximately 33% in order to bring those items in line with other similar items.
    * Proficiency Bonuses have been added to the game. Some sets of equippable items have been added that will give bonus effects to the player only if they have a specific skill, such as Leatherworking.

You can then use the same command (control-left click) on additional items to add to the preview appearance. In addition, the Auction House now has a checkbox in the upper right-hand corner; if checked, any item you click on within the Auction House will automatically be previewed on your character.
    * Need Before Greed and Group Loot options have been improved. The rolling window that appears when an item of the threshold and above is looted now has three buttons: a Need button (the dice), a Greed button (the coin), and a close button. Any players who select Need will get a chance to roll first for the item, with the high roller winning.

    * The temporary mana cost reduction of Burst of Knowledge and similar effects is now reflected in tooltips.
    * Quest rewards are now linked in chat like other items gained.
    * You can auto-equip items while in flight by right clicking on them, as you would normally.
    * You can now use the Escape key to exit out of pop up dialogues.
    * Fixed bug preventing the Release Spirit dialog from showing if you die while jumping in lava.
    * Fixed lua error when relinking poor and standard quality items from loot messages.
    * Consumable items on the action bar will now always show the number remaining, even if there are none in your inventory.
    * You can create the directory InterfaceIcons, and any 32x32 .blp or .tga files you put in there will be available in the icon list for your macros.
    * Pet spells in macros are now supported, both using /cast and using CastSpellByName().
    * If you omit the rank of a spell in /cast or CastSpellByName(), it will use the highest rank of the spell which you know.
    * While it will still be possible to override files in Interface/FrameXML, doing so is discouraged (and is likely to become impossible in a future release). Significant API additions are being made to eliminate the need for such direct FrameXML changes.
    * You will now be able to list .lua files directly in the addon .toc file.
    * The SetPoint() and SetAllPoints() script functions can take an actual frame instead of a frame name.
    * TargetNearest* script functions will only work in response to a button click or a key binding, to discourage addons which scan the battlefield for targets.
    * Addon-specific Saved Variables!
          o Each addon's saved variables will be saved in the file WTFAccount{accountname}SavedVariables{addonname}.lua, and will only be loaded when the addon is loaded.

            IMPORTANT: The first time you enter the game with this change, you must make sure all your addons are enabled, or their saved variables will be lost! If you accidentally do this once, you can recover by quitting the game, moving your backup SavedVariables.lua into place and restarting the game with addons enabled.

    * Addon Loading On Demand!
          o If you add the following line to your addon's .toc file, it will not be loaded at the normal load time, it will instead be dynamically loaded upon request:

            ## LoadOnDemand: 1

            You can query to see if an addon is loaded by using the new IsAddOnLoaded("addonname") function, and you can load an addon dynamically using the LoadAddOn("addonname") function. This function returns true if the addon is loaded successfully, and can be safely and efficiently called even if the addon is already loaded.

            For your convenience, the function UIParentLoadAddOn("addonname") is provided which will attempt to load the addon and pop up an error message if it failed to load for any reason.

            Once an addon is loaded, the ADDON_LOADED event is sent, with arg1 set to the name of the addon. An addon can listen for that event, and when it recieves that event with it's own name, it can safely access its saved variables.

            An important thing to note is that when an addon is loaded dynamically, it doesn't have access to any of the virtual frame templates that are defined by FrameXML, including font definitions.

    * New Scripting Functions
          o debugprofilestart() - starts a timer for profiling during debugging.
          o millis = debugprofilestop() - return the time in milliseconds since the last call to debugprofilestart() 
    * New UI Element Member Functions
          o handlerFunction = Frame:GetScript("handler") - (for handlers like "OnShow", "OnEnter", etc) which returns the current event handler for a frame.
          o Frame:SetScript("handler", function) - sets the action/event handler for a frame (or removes it with a nil function)
          o Frame:SetBackdrop(nil) / Frame:SetBackdrop({bgFile = "bgFile", edgeFile = "edgeFile", tile = false, tileSize = 0, edgeSize = 32, insets = { left = 0, right = 0, top = 0, bottom = 0 }}) (Note: This is a table argument)
          o FontString:SetFont("font", size [, "flags"]).
          o StatusBar:SetStatusBarTexture("file" [, "layer"])
          o lines = ScrollingMessageFrame:GetMaxLines()
          o ScrollingMessageFrame:SetMaxLines(lines)
          o ScrollingMessageFrame:EnableFading([isEnabled]) (Defaults to true)
          o ScrollingMessageFrame:SetFadeDuration(seconds)
          o ScrollingMessageFrame:SetTimeVisible(seconds)
          o ScrollingMessageFrame:Clear()
          o lines = EditBox:GetHistoryLines()
          o EditBox:SetHistoryLines(lines)
          o EditBox:SetIgnoreArrows([isIgnored]) (Defaults to true)
          o r,g,b,a = FontString:GetTextColor()
          o Frame:SetParent(nil, or "parent" or parentFrame)
          o numChildren = Frame:GetNumChildren()
          o child1, child2, child3, ... = Frame:GetChildren() 
    * Addon Saved Variables
          o SavedVariables will no longer drop stored numbers to single precision.
          o Infinite/Nan values no longer cause corrupted SavedVariables.lua file. (Written as nils with comment) 
    * Chat and Combat Logging
          o The script functions ChatFrameLog() and ToggleCombatLogFileWrite() are obsolete.
          o Added script function: isLogging=LoggingChat([newState]) (Returns new state (or current state if no argument))
          o Added script function: isLogging=LoggingCombat([newState]) (Returns new state (or current state if no argument))
          o New slash command /chatlog toggles chat logging (/combatlog toggles combat logging)
          o The file for the chat log is LogsWoWChatLog.txt and the file for the combat log is LogsWoWCombatLog.txt
          o Chat and combat log files will be appended to rather than overwritten.
          o You now receive combat log messages and damage feedback when you are being attacked by creatures you can't see.
          o If you call a tamed Deepmoss Hatchling, you are no longer notified that you hatched.
          o Fixed disconnection caused by relinking an item in a different locale than that of your client.
          o Looted items now always show their names in the appropriate quality color.
          o You now get combat feedback when you take damage from unseen opponents, like the Unseen in Raven Hill.
          o Fixed damage display on the character sheet when you have Fury of the Frostwolf or Stormpike's Salvation.
