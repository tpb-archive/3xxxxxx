Lyrics : 

They see me rollin'
They hatin'
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' 
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Police think they can see me lean;
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen.
For me to see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen.
Ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up."
Next to the Playstation controller
There's a full clip in my pistola;
Turn a jacker into a coma.
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone;
Just tryin' to make you horny, ain't tryin' to have no babies.
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies.
Law's on patrol; you know they hate me.
Music turned all the way up and to the maximum;
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some.
But we packin' somethin' that we have
And, um, will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell. I'm grippin' oak.
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow.
Twins steady twistin' like hit this dough;
Pull up from behind and im sittin low.
Windows down, gotta stop pollution.
CDs change; niggas like "Who is that producin'?"
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

I been drinkin' and smokin'; holdin' shit
'Cause a brother can't focus.
I gotta get to home 'fore the po-po's scope
This big ol Excursion
Swervin',
All up in the curve, man.
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again
Is in again;
We in the wind.
Doin' a hundred while I come from the block
And rollin another one up;
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck.
I got a revolver in my right hand;
40 oz on my lap, freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all.
Comin' up pretty deep, me and my do-jo.
I gotta get to backstreets;
Wanted by the six-pounds
And I got heat.
shots to the block;
We creep-creep. Pop-pop.
Hope cops don't see me;
On a low key.
With no regard for the law,
We dodge 'em like fuck-'em-all.
But I won't get caught up
And brought up
On charges for none of y'all.
Keep a gun in car
And a blunt to spark,
But, well, if you want,
Nigga,poppin'you dark.
Ready or not, we gon' bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Do what you thinkin' so,
I tried to let you go.
Turn on my blinker light
And then I swang it slow.
And they upset for sure
'Cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drinkin' drough.
So they get behind me,
Tryin' to check my tags.
Look at my rearview and they smilin',
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong; keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' it's racial profilin'.
Houston, TX, you can check my tags;
Pull me over, try to check my slab.
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast.
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them,
Givin' a damn 'bout not feeling my attitude.
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood.
I'ma laugh at you
And then I have to cruise.
You're a number two
On some old DJ Screw.
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue.
This a message to the law; tells 'em "We hate you."
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known.
Tippin' down; I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome.
Bookin' my phone; findin' a chick I wanna bone.
Like they couldn't stop me I'mma bout to pull up at your home
And it's on.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
