In a whirlwind turn of events, Sandra and Tracey take the UK by storm, hitting number one in the record charts and inadvertently winning the Turner Prize. As far as the press is concerned, fat is the new black... Throughout their journey into the world of celebrity, the girls maintain their unique and endearing vulgarity, coupled with an innocence that draws the British public to their cause. However, in private, jealousy is driving a wedge between Sandra and Tracey as they both vie for the attentions of Cooley. Only when he regains his mental faculties and turns on our unlikely heroines, do they realise that friendship is the only real thing they have in the mad world they've become a part of.
