The future of racing is here, and it's called MOTORHEAD. This game allows you to hop in one of 10 streamlined racers and test your skills on eight obstacle-filled courses that wind through urban, desert, and seaside terrain. Play modes include the standard Time Attack, Single Race, League, and Head-to-Head competition found in any decent racing game. One unique feature of MOTORHEAD is that you can choose between 30 or 60 frames per second. Choosing 60fps gives the game a polished look, but you're limited to a three-car field. While going with 30fps hurts in the visual department, it does expand the field to seven cars; you'll probably want to experiment with both to figure out which one works best for you.. This futuristic racer has impressive visuals and cleverly designed vehicles that help put you in a futuristic state of mind. So if you're in the mood for a fast and fun racing experience, get your hands on MOTORHEAD.
