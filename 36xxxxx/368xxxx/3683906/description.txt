A quick word about Vipersdenforums.com.
The "self proclaimed" founder Tauro of that website LIED to forum boasting there was a RIAA law to take effect last November 2006. Turns out that was nothing but a bullshit lie and thus his aliby to edit posts at the forum. Tauro cut a deal with File Factory and majority downloads are text files that link directly to File Factory. Members are FORCED to reply to posts to gain access to porn. The File Factory account was created by Tauro under VDF. Don't make one man filthy rich by profiting off his own members bandwidth who post porn there. Simply put, "it's a low down dirty shame"
