Synopsis
Charles Bronson demonstrates exactly what tough is in this two-fisted action drama about a drifter suddenly caught up in the fight game during the Great Depression. Chaney, a down-on-his-luck loner, hops a freight train to New Orleans where, on the seedier side of town, he tries to make some quick money the only way he knows how ?with his fists. Chaney approaches a hustler named Speed and convinces him that he can win big money for them both. Chaney wins a few tough illegal fights bare-fisted but Speed?s carelessness with his money and indebtedness to a gang of thugs forces Chaney to fight one last match with Street, a huge monster of a man. The final bout is a no-holds-barred, knock-down, drag-out fight that Bronson fans will love.
