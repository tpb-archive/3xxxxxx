At a party, a guest brings out a Ouija board, and they attempt to contact a spirit 

he knows. The spirit does appear, but it becomes apparent to the one who brought 

the Ouija board that this is an evil spirit that is impersonating his spirit, and 

despite warnings not to use the board alone, a woman uses it alone, and becomes 

harassed by the evil spirit, his goal to possess her so he can walk the earth 

again.
